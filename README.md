# Doodle-Jump-Machine-Learning
 
This will be how we collaborate on this project

We will be using Github Desktop, which each of you should have installed.

Create a fork by press the Fork button on the top right of our repository's [homepage](https://github.com/SHC-Robotics-Team-8255/Doodle-Jump-Machine-Learning)

In Github Desktop, under the repositories tab select "Add/Clone Repository". Select the repository that starts with your username, like "myname/doodlejump"

In Visual Studio, just write your code in the already created methods/functions provided. Feel free to create more as you wish.

However, avoid writing code in the same spot as your filemate. The conflicts between your versions of code could result in annoying conflicts. **Communication is key!**

Commit smaller changes to your branch often. Not only is it a log of what you have done, but it is something to look back to if something goes wrong or gets deleted. You can always revert what you have committed.

Don't forget to occasionally sync with Github servers by pressing the top right button that either reads Fetch, Push, or Pull Origin. Do this before and after you work on it.

When you think your changes are stable (they work or at least dont cause errors) and want to share with the rest of the group, follow these steps:
1. Make sure all of your changes are committed on your fork
1. Sync once more to be sure
1. Under "Branch", select "Create Pull Request"
1. Make sure the base repository is listed as "SHC-Robotics-Team-8255/Doodle-Jump" with base "main" and the head repository (your fork) is listed as "yourusername/Doodle-Jump-Machine-Learning" and comparing your main branch.
1. You are going to see an overview of all of the changes you have made. See if everything checks out, then select "Create Pull Request"
1. Once you press that, give your pull request a descriptive name and a description that tells me everything one would need to know about your changes.
1. At the top right, under Reviewers, click the gear icon. Enter my username, 22preich, and select it. Do not press merge.

And you are done! Well, almost. Once I quickly check your code for any problems and merge it, you will probably want to get the latest version of code from the group repository.

1. In GitHub Desktop, under Branch, select "Rebase Current Branch"
1. Select the upstream/main branch (the group repo) and click "start rebase"
1. This will import the changes from the group repo into your own, however, there may be a conflict.
1. If so, Github will ask you to change it to how you want it to look. Once you finish, it will recognize that you solved the issue and allow you to continue.
1. Congratulations, you are actually done. This may seem like a long list, but it should be able to be done very quick and allows for maximum flexibility


### I have set everything up so that you guys dont have to worry about doing anything wrong. I'll merge your pull requests for you, so no need to worry about anything.
